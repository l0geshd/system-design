# SYSTEM DESIGN CONCETPS
## Scalability
- Ablity of the system to handle load/large volume of requests
  ### vertical scaling
  - adding multiple instace of the compute or storage
  ### horizonatal scaling
  - adding more memeory or processing power to existing machine
## Reliability
- reliability is the probability a system will fail in a given period
- A reliable distributed system achieves this through redundancy of both the software components and data.
## Availability 
- availability is the time a system remains operational to perform its required function in a specific period.
## Efficiency
- Two standard measures of its efficiency are 
  -  *response time (or latency)* that denotes the delay to obtain the first item 
  -  *throughput (or bandwidth)* which denotes the number of items delivered in a given time unit (e.g., a second).

## Manageability
-  Serviceability or manageability is the simplicity and speed with which a system can be repaired or maintained; 
-  if the time to fix a failed system increases, then availability will decrease.
