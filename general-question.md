- Ready heavy or Write heavy
- Read write ratio
- High availablity needed?
- Throttling requests for users
- is any service is having sigle point of failure

## High level esÂ timates
- Traffic estimates

## 4 DropBox / GoogleDrive / OneDrive
- split large files into chunks and calculate the hash
- if the systems can go offline then use queues to deliver the messages
- when storing large files use block storage and use separate metadata db
- partitioning based on fileid hash so that realted chunks will be in same partition
